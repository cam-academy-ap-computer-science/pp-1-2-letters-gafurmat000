Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

Unfortunately, one of the stated requirements of the assignment
was that your main method should have only three method calls
in it.  All the rest of your methods had to be nested in the
letters.  I had to remove 5 points because you put more than
the three method calls into your main method.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have comments separating the method
calls that were for each letter, to make your program's
structure more clear.
